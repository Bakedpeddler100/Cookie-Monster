In this repo, you will learn the basics of the HTML & CSS coding languages. The repo is based on my learning that I completed in less than 7 days, and you are free to work a little everyday, or binge the entire stuff all at once. By the end, you will build a porfolio website from scratch, and be given the tools to customize the project with your name, colors, and images so that you can be proud to share it on social media, or as part of your CV/resume. Last, but not least, it's an great chance to launch your website live on the internet! Sounds exciting? Ready? Ok! Let's get started learning to code.
# Day_1
Download Sublime Text. It's a text editor,that I love to use. A text editor is an application that we can use to code HTML and CSS (and nearly every other programming language).
