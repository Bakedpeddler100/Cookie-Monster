In this repo, you will learn the basics of the HTML & CSS coding languages. The repo is based on my learning that I completed in less than 7 days, and you are free to work a little everyday, or binge the entire stuff all at once. By the end, you will build a porfolio website from scratch, and be given the tools to customize the project with your name, colors, and images so that you can be proud to share it on social media, or as part of your CV/resume. Last, but not least, it's an great chance to launch your website live on the internet! Sounds exciting? Ready? Ok! Let's get started learning to code.

( That's all for today, and also, do organise your desktop<just spend the day_1 in it> just make sure that your desktop is not an abominable mess. A part of being a good developer
is being organized with your computer. The computer is the tool you are going to use and so, trust me on this, you're gonna fall behind if you don't have a good organization. So take a second to do that if you need, says my mentor.
# Day_2(Party Tips! HTML is the Structure of your Page)
